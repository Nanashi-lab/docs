# Using WASI interfaces from Go

Golem implements and exports a subset of the [WASI](https://wasi.dev) interfaces, as well as its own **runtime interfaces**.

The [Golem Go SDK](/docs/go-language-guide/golem-go-sdk) provides idiomatic wrappers on a subset of these interfaces, but it is also possible to use the generated bindings directly.

## WIT specifications

The full set of WIT specifications Golem implements is available in the following public repository:

https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/tree/main/wit/deps

The following table lists all packages provided by Golem:

| Package           | Description                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `golem:api`       | Golem's Runtime API                                                                         |
| `golem:rpc`       | Provides support for Worker to Worker communication                                         |

| `wasi:io`         | Interface for working with futures and streams                                              |

| `wasi:logging`    | Interface for logging messages                                                              |
| `wasi:random`     | Interface for generating random numbers                                                     |
| `wasi:sockets`    | Interface for working with TCP and UDP sockets (currently not supporting durable execution) |

## Additional Golem runtime APIs

This section describes Golem-specific functionalities which are available through the Golem runtime API but does not have an idiomatic Go wrapper in the `golem-go` library yet.

### Generate an idempotency key

Golem provides a function to generate an idempotency key (a UUID) which can be passed to external systems to ensure that the same request is not processed multiple times.

It is guaranteed that this idempotency key will always be the same (per occurrence) even if the worker is restarted due to a crash.

To generate the idempotency key, use:

```go
key := exmaple.GolemApi0_2_0_HostGenerateIdempotencyKey()
```

where `example` is the component name used for the `wit` binding generation.
